While working at MisterGreen as a Lead Software Engineer and Designer, I crafted a comprehensive branding solution for MisterGreen, a forward-thinking company dedicated to accelerating the transition to sustainable personal transportation in The Netherlands. The project encompassed creating a distinctive logo, color scheme, and typography that resonated with the eco-conscious ethos of the brand. The visual identity seamlessly blended a modern aesthetic with a green narrative, embodying MisterGreen's commitment to a cleaner, greener future. The branding now offers a visually engaging and cohesive identity across various touchpoints, helping MisterGreen stand out in a competitive market while promoting sustainable mobility solutions.
