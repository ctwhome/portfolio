# Hey, I'm Jesse

I'm a Senior Research Software Engineer based in Amsterdam with over 17 years of experience turning complex research challenges into production-ready software.

I work as a **Research Software Engineer** at the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/), where I build tools for scientific research across health, life sciences, climate science, digital humanities, and cultural heritage.

Independently, I run **[CTW Studio](https://ctw.studio)**—building software for research and society, and developing my own products like IdeasDiamond and Notidian.

## Recent Work at eScience Center

I build scalable data infrastructure, deploy machine learning systems, and create interactive visualizations of large-scale scientific data. Some highlights:

- **FAIVOR** — FAIR ML validation platform for healthcare AI
- **Ruisdael** — Real-time volumetric visualization of terabyte-scale atmospheric data
- **Mine-DD** — GIS dashboards for climate-health research used internationally
- **COLLaiTE** — Collaborative annotation tools that sparked international research working groups
