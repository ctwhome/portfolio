The man who kill Jesus (the name) 

🚨 I’m Not Jesus Anymore. Call Me Jesse.

Let’s get one thing straight:
My name is Jesús García González. Born and raised in Madrid. Spanish as hell. Classic name. Common. Clean. Biblical.

But somewhere along the way — specifically the moment I crossed a border — that name stopped being a name and turned into a fucking sideshow.

Every meeting. Every Zoom. Every coffee with a stranger.

> “Wait… like Jesus?”
“Are you really named after God?”
“Should I pray to you?”
“Where’s your beard?”
“Do you walk on water too?”



No. No, Karen, I don’t.
I write TypeScript. I’m a product designer and Researcher. I build research software tools. I clean up toddler puke at 2AM and drink magnesium like a 90-year-old biohacker. There is nothing divine going on here.

✈️ Moving from Spain to the Netherlands: Culture shock, name edition

When I moved to Amsterdam I knew life would change.
Language? Sure. Weather? Obviously.
But my name turning into a daily comedy bit?
Didn’t see that one coming.

In Spain, my nickname was “Curi” — a sweet, short version of a larger 3 generations family name. Friends, family, core crew only.
But here? No one gets it. I’d get more recognition introducing myself as “Wi-Fi Not Detected.”

So yeah, that died too.

🧠 I considered rebranding. Fully. Like a company does.

If my name was now a liability, I had to choose something people could say without giggling or breaking into theology class.

So I explored:


---

🔸 Jes Gonzalez

Sounds like a UI element that didn’t load properly.

Pros:

Closer to my real name

No Jesus jokes

Short and kinda cool


Cons:

People think it’s short for Jessica

Still gets weird looks

Doesn’t feel natural out loud


---

🔸 Jex Gonzalez

Yeah, no. Feels like the name of a cyberpunk DJ who lives in a data center.

Pros:

Unique as hell

Google loves it

Total brand control


Cons:

Do I want to explain that every time instead of Jesus now?

Slightly too try-hard for someone who just wants to build good shit and sleep well.



---

🔸 J.G. Gonzalez

Very author-y. Might use this if I start writing sci-fi.

Pros:

Mysterious, cool

Works for serious stuff


Cons:

Not friendly

No one knows how to say it out loud

Am I writing manifestos or building productivity apps?



---

✅ And finally: Jesse Gonzalez

Pros:

People actually know how to say it.

No God jokes.

Real name in many cultures.

Still feels close to “Jesús” but without the divine baggage.

Feels like me — but cleaned up for international airspace.


Cons:

It’s kind of plain.

I might meet another Jesse someday and feel weird about it.

That’s it.



---

So yeah. It’s Jesse now.

If you know me from back in Madrid and still call me Curi — don’t stop. You’re family. That name is sacred.

But if you’re meeting me now, from work, from the internet, from the indie dev scene, or from some random productivity forum — just call me Jesse Gonzalez.

No sermon. No sandals. Just me, my code, my tools, my kid, and my magnesium pills.


---

tl;dr

Yo — 🎤 
I’m not Jesus, stop that prayer,
Ain’t got time, I’m not your savior.
No robe, no beard, no holy flair,
Just code, matcha, and ergonomic chairs.

You want a name that works? Then yes:
It’s Jesse G, no need to guess.
No more gospel, no more stress,
Just Jesse Gonzalez — say it, bless.
