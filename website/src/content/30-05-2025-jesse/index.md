I go by Jesse Gonzalez now. 

Let’s get one thing straight. My passport name is Jesús García González. Born and raised in Madrid. Spanish as hell. Classic name. Common. Clean. Biblical.

But somewhere along the way — specifically the moment I crossed a border — that name stopped being a name and turned into an icebreaker sideshow.

Every meeting. Every Zoom. Every coffee with a stranger.

>Wait… like Jesus?”  
>“Are you really named after God?”  
>“Should I pray to you?”  
>“Where’s your beard?”  
>“Do you walk on water too?


No. No, Steve, I don’t.  

I write TypeScript. I’m a product designer and researcher. I build research software tools with lots of colors, clean up toddler puke at 2 AM and drink magnesium like a 90-year-old biohacker. There is nothing divine going on here.


### Moving from Spain to the Netherlands: Culture Shock, Name Edition

When I moved to Amsterdam I knew life would change. Language? Sure. Weather? Obviously. But my name turning into a daily comedy bit? Didn’t see that one coming.

In Spain my nickname is “Curi” — a sweet, short version of a larger three-generation family name. For friends and core crew only.
But here? No one gets it. I’d get more recognition introducing myself as “Wi-Fi Not Detected.”

So yeah, that died too.

### I Considered a Full Rebranding, Like a Company Does

If my name was now a liability, I had to choose something people could say without giggling or breaking into theology class.

So I explored:


**Jes Gonzalez**

Sounds like a UI element that didn’t load properly. With pros being closer to my real name, no Jesus jokes, short and kinda cool. BUT, 

- People think it’s short for Jessica
- Still gets weird looks
- Doesn’t feel natural out loud


**Jex Gonzalez**

Yeah, no. Feels like the name of a cyberpunk DJ who lives in a data center. It is unique as hell, Google SEO loves it and it has total brand control, but:

- Do I want to explain that every time instead of Jesus now?
- Slightly too try-hard for someone who just wants to build things and sleep well.


**J.G. Gonzalez**

Very author-y. Might use this if I start writing sci-fi. Mysterious, cool. Works for serious stuff. But again: 

- Not friendly
- No one knows how to say it out loud
- Am I writing manifestos or building productivity apps?



---

And finally: **Jesse Gonzalez**

- People actually know how to say it.
- No God jokes.
- Real name in many cultures.

Still feels close to “Jesús” but without the divine baggage. Feels like me — but cleaned up for international airspace.

It’s kind of plain though and I might meet another Jesse someday and feel weird about it.

So yeah. It’s Jesse now. People might pronounce it Jess-eh (Dutch way) or Jess-ie (international) and that's okay with me. 

If you know me from back in Spain and still call me Curi — don’t stop. You’re family. That name is sacred.

But if you’re meeting me now, from work, from the internet, from the indie dev scene, or from some random productivity forum — just call me Jesse, Jesse Gonzalez.

No sermon. No sandals. Just me, my code, my tools, my kid, and my magnesium pills.

**tl;dr**

Yo — 🎤 

I’m not Jesus, stop that prayer,  
I don't float, I climb the stairs.   
No robe with beard, no holy flair.   
Just code, matcha, and ergonomic chairs.

You want a name that works? Then yes:  
It’s Jesse G, no need to guess.  
No more gospel, no more stress,  
Just Jesse Gonzalez — say it, bless.
