"Leap Learn" is an application that focuses on gesture recognition technology, utilizing Leap Motion. It provides a platform where users can program and interpret new gestures in three dimensions, connecting them with various system actions. 

The application supports customization of interaction experiences through End User Development (EUD) techniques and Programming by Examples (PbE). Featuring an intuitive interface and a modified $1 recognition algorithm, "Leap Learn" offers precise hand gesture interpretation. The project represents a step towards personalized and natural user interaction, enhancing experiences across various domains.
