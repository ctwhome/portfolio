## The Archaitect Era
Sorry for the "era" word, I probably meant months.

**"ArchAItect"** is a combination of **"archaic,"** **"AI,"** and **"architect."** From one to the other because of AI. Mainstream AI is enabling people to create anything they want. The limits are in the limits of our imagination. Which makes me think a lot about what architects are. They design, dream, and know the field to create structures. In the same way, a writer has knowledge of the language, the audiences, and the structure, so they pick their dreamed topic, design the content, and write it. With one exception, they don't write it anymore, just as architects don't build the houses with their own hands.

I have been thinking of what term would better suit the new generation of 100X creators, designers, coders, artists, medics, and so on. But I think I just found it; it is the "archaitect" era. A transitional phase between those who still reject embracing the AI tools available and the ones who are using them to become architects in their fields.

I truly believe with this approach, anyone with sufficient knowledge and skills can create anything they want, start new endeavors, and even change their world and communities and work.

I don't know how long this transition will be, so I called it an era, although at the speed at which things are developing, it is not a long time. Either you become archaic, or an architect. What do you choose?

The problem right now is that to use the new AI, although highly available to everyone, it still requires some effort to understand how they work and how to use them. How to prompt is key for anything you want to achieve from the AI, either to learn a topic (explain me like I am 5) or to build/write/draw/code/design/create/whatever you want.

The problem is that the new AI is not a magic wand; it is a tool and needs to be used with the right mindset.

So let me ask you again, do you want to be archaic, or do you want to put in the time to master the new AI tools?
