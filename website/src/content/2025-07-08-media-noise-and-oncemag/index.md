## The Problem of Media Noise

After 15 years of crafting digital experiences and placing users at the center of everything I design, I found myself trapped in the most poorly designed user experience of all: modern media consumption. The irony wasn't lost on me - here I was, preaching user-centered design by day, while doomscrolling through anxiety-inducing headlines by night.

As someone with a Masters in AI, I couldn't help but notice how algorithms had essentially gamified our attention spans. These systems weren't optimizing for user wellbeing or knowledge transfer - they were optimizing for one metric: engagement. And let me tell you, nothing says "engagement" quite like rage-clicking through 47 articles about why your generation is responsible for the death of fabric softener.

## The Cost of Doomscrolling (A UX Designer's Nightmare)

Picture this: A Research Software Engineer who specializes in creating "seamless digital experiences" spending three hours seamlessly transitioning from one anxiety-inducing article to another. The user journey? Start with checking the weather, end up reading conspiracy theories about birds. The conversion funnel? Sanity in, existential dread out.

My behavioral science background was screaming at me. I was watching myself become a case study in operant conditioning - refresh, scroll, dopamine hit, repeat. The platforms had created the perfect Skinner box, and I was the pigeon pecking at the news feed button hoping for... what exactly? Enlightenment? Hardly.

The worst part? I knew exactly what was happening. I could map out the dark UX patterns, identify the persuasive design elements, and still found myself three hours deep into an article about someone's controversial opinion on sandwich construction.

## Building Resilience Through Design Thinking (Or: Physician, Heal Thyself)

So I did what any self-respecting engineer would do: I decided to solve my own problem. Enter [oncemag.com](https://oncemag.com) - my attempt at applying Design Thinking methodology to the information overload crisis.

The process went something like this:
- **Empathize**: Realize I'm drowning in digital noise (also, so is everyone else)
- **Define**: The problem isn't information - it's information without intention
- **Ideate**: What if news consumption wasn't designed like a slot machine?
- **Prototype**: Build a platform that respects cognitive load
- **Test**: Use it myself and stop checking if the world ended every 5 minutes

## A Different Approach to Information Architecture

As someone who's built everything from 3D point cloud navigation systems to corporate platforms, I approached oncemag.com like any other UX challenge. The user story was simple: "As a human with finite attention, I want to stay informed without losing my mind."

The platform leverages my belief in user feedback and iterative design, but flips the script. Instead of optimizing for time-on-site (the metric that's destroying our collective attention span), it optimizes for time-well-spent. Revolutionary concept: what if we measured success by how quickly users could get valuable information and then go live their lives?

Using principles from human-computer interaction, I designed oncemag.com to work with our cognitive limitations, not exploit them. No infinite scroll (because infinity is exhausting), no "BREAKING" everything (because not everything is broken), and definitely no "You won't believe what happens next!" (because I probably will, and it's probably disappointing).

## Democratizing Sanity in the Attention Economy

My work has always focused on democratizing communication between users and organizations. With oncemag.com, I'm trying to democratize something even more fundamental: the right to not be constantly manipulated by engagement algorithms.

The platform represents my optimistic lens on the world - the belief that we can create digital experiences that enhance rather than hijack our lives. It's built on the radical assumption that people are capable of consuming information thoughtfully when given tools that support rather than subvert their intentions.

As someone who looks at everyday activities seeking optimization opportunities, I couldn't ignore the glaring inefficiency of modern media consumption. We're essentially running our brains on Windows Vista when we could be running on... well, anything else.

## The Research Software Engineer's Rebellion

Building oncemag.com is my small act of rebellion against the attention merchants. It's applying Agile Kanban to information consumption - small, manageable batches of curated content instead of an overwhelming backlog of everything that's ever happened.

In true prototyping fashion, it's an ongoing experiment. Can we build resilient information consumption habits? Can we use technology to protect our attention rather than harvest it? Can we finally admit that we don't need to have an opinion about every single thing that happens on the internet?

I'm betting we can. Because if there's one thing my years in tech have taught me, it's that the best solutions often come from scratching your own itch. And boy, was this itch driving me crazy.

So here's to building tools that respect our humanity, to UX that doesn't exploit our psychology, and to finally admitting that maybe, just maybe, we don't need to know what that celebrity had for breakfast. 

Your cognitive load will thank you.
