### Workspace Dependencies

The website project uses `ctw-kit` as a workspace dependency with the configuration `"ctw-kit": "workspace:*"` in its package.json. This setup:

- Links the local ctw-kit package directly into the website project during development
- In production, it will be replaced with the actual published version of ctw-kit from npm
- Allows immediate testing of ctw-kit changes in the website without publishing
- Ensures consistent versioning between development and production environments

The asterisk (*) in `workspace:*` means it will use whatever version is available in the workspace, rather than being locked to a specific version. This is particularly useful during development as it always uses the local workspace version.
