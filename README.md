## Development

Each project maintains its own dependencies and can be developed independently. Navigate to the specific project directory to run its development commands.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (preferred) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL (for template projects)

### Global Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

2. Install workspace dependencies
```bash
bun install
```

3. Choose a project to work on and follow its specific setup instructions above.

Note: The root-level `bun install` is necessary as this is a monorepo using workspaces for `ctw-kit` and `website`. The templates in `top-sveltekit` are standalone and require their own separate installation as shown in their setup instructions.

### Workspace Dependencies

The website project uses `ctw-kit` as a workspace dependency with the configuration `"ctw-kit": "workspace:*"` in its package.json. This setup:

- Links the local ctw-kit package directly into the website project during development
- In production, it will be replaced with the actual published version of ctw-kit from npm
- Allows immediate testing of ctw-kit changes in the website without publishing
- Ensures consistent versioning between development and production environments

The asterisk (*) in `workspace:*` means it will use whatever version is available in the workspace, rather than being locked to a specific version. This is particularly useful during development as it always uses the local workspace version.
