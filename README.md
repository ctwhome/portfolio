## Motivation and Personal opinion
I use the same technologies in my web applications. SvelteKit is awesome, and developing with it is a pleasure. I use this repository as a showcase, resources and best practices to follow for all my applications. My motivation for keeping it updated is that, at the end of the day, this repository also serves as my official portfolio. If you find it interesting and use any of the ideas seen here, please give it some credit in your applications as well.
