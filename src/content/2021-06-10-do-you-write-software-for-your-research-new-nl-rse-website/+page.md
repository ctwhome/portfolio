This website is a new structure and content redesign for the Netherlands Group of Research Software Engineers website. In collaboration with Lieke de Boer and the people from the NL-RSE, I have made a completely new portal where the community can find everything related to the Research Sofware engineers group in the Netherlands. 

The technology stack uses NuxtJs with Nuxt Content, an RSE Feed you can subscribe to, custom animations, and a performance experience without downtime. You can see a preview running here: [https://nl-rse.netlify.app/](https://nl-rse.netlify.app/)
